# Operational-MIS-Service-Level-Performance-Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an **end-to-end MIS (Management Information System) and Service Level Performance Analysis** using **daily, weekly, and monthly operational data**.  
The objective is to monitor **SLA, productivity, absenteeism, and call volumes**, identify key drivers behind SLA misses, and generate **actionable insights** to support operational and workforce decision-making.

This project closely mirrors **real-world WFM / MIS reporting environments** used in large service organizations.
## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Track **Incoming, Answered, and Abandoned Calls**
- Monitor **Service Level Agreement (SLA %)**
- Analyze **Agent Productivity and Absenteeism**
- Identify **drivers of SLA misses**
- Support **daily, weekly, and monthly MIS reporting**
- Enable **data-driven operational decisions**

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of operational call-center metrics at multiple levels:

### 🔹 Daily Level
- Date  
- Incoming Calls  
- Answered Calls  
- Abandoned Calls  
- SLA %  
- Absenteeism %  
- Productivity  

### 🔹 Weekly Level
- Week Number  
- Average SLA %  
- Average Productivity  
- Average Absenteeism %  
- Total Incoming Calls  

### 🔹 Monthly Level
- Month  
- Average SLA %  
- Average Productivity  
- Average Absenteeism %  
- Total Incoming Calls  

📊 **Scale:**  
- **4.1+ million incoming calls** analyzed across multiple months

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **MS Excel** – Data cleaning, Pivot Tables, MIS summaries  
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboards  
- **Power Query** – ETL, data transformation, validation  
- **SQL** – Aggregation logic and metric validation

## 📈 Key Metrics Analyzed
- **SLA %** – Calls answered within defined service thresholds  
- **Productivity** – Agent output efficiency  
- **Absenteeism %** – Impact of attendance on service levels  
- **Call Volume** – Incoming vs Answered vs Abandoned calls  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Average **SLA stabilized around 79–80%** across months  
- **Absenteeism (~25–30%)** was the strongest driver of SLA dips  
- Stable productivity helped absorb **high call volume spikes**  
- SLA dropped sharply on days with **high absenteeism and sudden volume surges**  
- Higher abandoned calls observed when staffing was not aligned with demand  

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Implement **real-time absenteeism monitoring**
- Use **intraday staffing and scheduling adjustments**
- Automate **SLA alerts and MIS dashboards**
- Maintain consistent **daily → weekly → monthly MIS cadence**
- Focus on **productivity optimization**, not just headcount increase
